PROMPT FOR REPLIT WEB ASSISTANT — EXECUTE

You are a world-class front-end lead. Take the current Companeeds landing and make it a minimalist, conversion-maximal cosmic portal. Maintain purity (one clear path → “Get Started” voice agent), but elevate motion, polish, and consistency to god-tier. Keep the brand royal purple only—no multicolor gradients.

0) Non-negotiables to restore/fix

Navbar/Logo: Logo + “Companeeds” back inside the navbar (top-left), sticky, smooth color-change on scroll (transparent over hero → blurred, slightly darker translucent bar after 120px). Wordmark shifts white ↔ deep purple based on section tone. Re-enable subtle idle float and micro-parallax on the logo. Rocket icon twinkles every ~10s.

Purple Integrity: All animated backgrounds remain royal purple family only (#6C4CFF / #5B36FF / #3A1CCC). No rainbow/other hues.

Final CTA: Color, shadows, and glow match the hero CTA exactly (same gradient, same hover, same icon animation).

Remove Apple emojis in the Process section. Replace with clean inline SVG line-icons (custom or lucide-style) in our purple palette.

1) Information Architecture (single page)

Hero / Portal Gate

Headline (keep): “We’ve Got Exactly What You Need”

Subheadline (tight, centered): “Tell us about your business — our AI will take it from there.”

Big primary CTA (rocket): Get Started → opens Voice Agent modal.

Background: layered starfield (3 depths), subtle parallax on mouse, portal ring behind headline (soft pulse/shimmer).

Micro link under CTA: “How it works ↓” smooth-scrolls to Process.

Why Companeeds (+ 30-day promise)

3 minimal value cards:

Cut Through the Noise — We’ve already vetted the best AI.

Real Results, Fast — We install, measure, iterate.

Scale or You Don’t Pay — 30-day prove-it pilot.

Beneath cards: thin, elegant box with the 30-day message, small lock icon, and mini trust bullets:

No credit card required · 30 days free · Real results guaranteed

Trusted By (logos)

Title: “AI systems trusted by teams our tech has served”

Grayscale logos with soft hover shimmer; accessible alt text.

Add a fine-print line below in 11–12px: “Logos represent teams served directly or via our implementation partners.”

The Process (3 steps) — no emojis

Step 1 — Speak to the Agent (mic SVG): Tell us goals, bottlenecks, stack.

Step 2 — Map Your AI Stack (diagram SVG): Vetted tools + custom automations.

Step 3 — Pilot → Scale (boost SVG): 30-day pilot; keep only what moves the needle.

Each card: glassmorphism panel, soft lift on hover, tiny star-sparkles that appear + fade (subtle).

Add a thin scroll-progress comet line that advances across the three steps while in view.

Final CTA (mirror the hero)

Dark purple galaxy background (same family as hero).

Headline: “Ready to jump timelines?”

CTA: Get Started (identical style/animation/behavior as hero).

Beneath: “No pressure. No fluff. Just results.”

2) Motion & Physics (tasteful, performant)

Use GSAP (vanilla JS) for timelines + ScrollTrigger. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Starfield: HTML <canvas> with 3 layers (different speed/blur/size). Occasional faint constellation lines connect nearby stars, then fade.

Parallax: hero starfield + portal ring (1–2% translation), navbar logo micro-float.

Section reveals: fade-up + 4–6px translate, 250–350ms, 30ms stagger.

Color-adaptive navbar: compute section tone; switch wordmark color (white on dark, deep purple on light). No hard jumps.

3) Design System (lock it in)

Colors:

Primary Purple #6C4CFF; Deep Purple #5B36FF; Space #0A0420; Accent depth #3A1CCC.

Gradients stay within this family only.

Typography: Sora or Inter for headings (800), Inter for body (17–18px). Tight hero LH, generous body spacing.

Buttons: pill shape, soft outer glow, rocket thrust flicker on hover.

Containers: max-width 1140–1200px; huge breathing room; plenty of negative space.

4) Voice Agent (CTA behavior)

Modal: glass panel with star drift behind; focus-trapped, ESC to close; keyboard accessible.

Big mic button → request mic. If unavailable, simulate transcript.

Guided prompts (short): company name, industry, biggest bottleneck, success metric, current tools.

End state: “Thanks — we’re preparing your tailored plan” + scheduler link placeholder.

All copy minimal and reassuring.

5) Accessibility & Performance

Respect prefers-reduced-motion; provide reduced-motion mode (no parallax; static star backdrop).

Optimize canvas (requestAnimationFrame; throttle when offscreen).

IntersectionObserver for reveals; no jQuery.

Lighthouse desktop ≥ 90.

6) Files to touch

index.html (structure & modal)

styles.css (tokens, layout, glass panels, navbar states)

main.js (GSAP timelines, ScrollTrigger, starfield engine, navbar color sync, voice agent modal)

/assets/icons/*.svg (mic, diagram, boost, lock, rocket)

/assets/logos/* (client logo placeholders)

7) Acceptance checklist (must pass)

 Navbar/Logo restored inside navbar; sticky; idle float; color-change on scroll works on all sections.

 Entire site stays in royal purple gradient family (no off-brand colors).

 Final CTA visually identical to hero CTA (gradient, glow, hover).

 Process icons are SVGs, not Apple emojis.

 Hero portal ring pulse + layered starfield parallax at 60fps (desktop).

 Voice Agent modal opens from both CTAs, accessible & focus-trapped.

 Trusted-by row with grayscale logos, shimmer hover, alt text, and fine-print.

 Reduced-motion mode removes parallax/constellations but keeps function.

 Smooth scroll, tasteful reveals, constellation micro-lines appear occasionally.

Implement now in the existing project and keep copy concise and premium.
