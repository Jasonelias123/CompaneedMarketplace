Please read this carefully before doing anything, and only build what’s actually missing. Do not break or overwrite anything already working.

⚠️ Important Instructions:
	•	✅ Check if login/signup/auth already exists — do not duplicate Firebase Auth if it’s already set up.
	•	✅ Only implement the following features if they’re truly not present in the project.
	•	❌ Do not expose any contact info (email, phone, etc.) of companies to developers or vice versa.
	•	✅ Any interaction must happen within the platform only (Firebase, in-app dashboards, etc.).

🔧 Improvements to Add (Only if Missing):

1. Developer Application System
	•	Add an “Apply to Project” or “Submit Proposal” button inside the project modal.
	•	Logged-in devs can submit a short message and optionally upload a pitch deck (PDF or image).
	•	Save this data in Firebase under a subcollection of the project.
	•	Each application should include: developer UID, name, message, pitch deck link (if uploaded), and timestamp.

2. “My Projects” Dashboard for Companies
	•	Show project posters a view of all their posted projects.
	•	Let them view applications only for their own projects.
	•	Optionally allow them to mark projects as Open / In Progress / Filled / Closed.
	•	Do not show dev emails or contact info, just their submitted message and attached pitch deck if present.

3. Developer Portfolios
	•	Let developers create/edit their profile page (bio, skills, project types, LinkedIn/GitHub links — but hide contact info).
	•	Allow companies to view dev profiles after they’ve applied to a project, but still hide all contact details.

4. Project Categorization
	•	Add categories/tags to projects (e.g. Web Dev, Mobile App, AI Agent, Automation, etc.).
	•	Let users filter or search by category on the “Browse Projects” page.

5. Notifications (Internal Only)
	•	Notify companies (inside Firebase or via UI alert) when a developer applies to one of their projects.
	•	Notify developers if their application is marked “Reviewed” or “Accepted” (optional).

6. Project Form Validation
	•	Add basic frontend validation for the project post form (e.g., required fields: title, budget, description).
	•	Show a visible error message if saving to Firebase fails.

7. Mobile UX Fixes
	•	Fix the modal overflow on mobile devices.
	•	Improve layout: use placeholders instead of fixed labels, and make the description box auto-expandable.

8. Admin Logging
	•	In the background, save all projects to a hidden adminProjects collection in Firebase for moderation.
	•	Optional: add a simple reCAPTCHA to the “Post Project” form to prevent spam.

✅ Make all changes while preserving existing working features and styling.
✅ You may stub or scaffold future dashboard features, but they should not be visible unless logged in.

Let me know if anything is unclear. This MVP needs to be robust, secure, and locked down before going live.
