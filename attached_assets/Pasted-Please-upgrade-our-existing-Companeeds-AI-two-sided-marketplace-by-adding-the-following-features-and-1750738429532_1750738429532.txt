Please upgrade our existing Companeeds AI two-sided marketplace by adding the following features and improvements. The goal is to create a premium, trusted platform for connecting companies with elite software/AI developers.
🔐 1. Client (Company) Project Poster Vetting
Add optional company intake form fields:
Company Name
Company Website
Industry
Have you worked with freelancers before? (yes/no)
What’s your ideal timeline? (dropdown)
What’s your expected project budget?
Optional “Verified Buyer” badge shown on company profiles if all fields are complete and admin-approved.
🔎 2. Smart Matching Logic
When a company posts a project, tag it with tech stack keywords (e.g., Python, React, OpenAI).
When a dev signs up, store their tech stack and experience.
Recommend matching developers to companies (and vice versa) based on stack, availability, and budget fit.
⭐ 3. Ratings and Reviews System
After each project is marked complete, trigger a two-way review form:
1–5 star rating
Text feedback
Criteria: Communication, Delivery Quality, On-Time, Professionalism
Store and show average rating + recent reviews on both dev and company profiles.
💬 4. Messaging System
Add a secure message/chat interface between devs and companies once a proposal is submitted.
Features:
Real-time or async messages
Notifications for unread messages
Admin moderation ability (optional)
💰 5. Escrow & Milestone Planning (Phase 2-Ready)
Add checkbox to each project: “Enable milestone payments”
Show companies an option to split payment (e.g., 50% upfront, 50% upon delivery).
Placeholder functionality for escrow: simulate fund locking + release flow.
📄 6. Legal & Terms Layer
Add checkbox before posting a project or proposal:
“I agree to the Terms of Use and understand that Companeeds AI is not liable for disputes.”
Add downloadable NDA and IP agreement templates linked in both user dashboards.
Admin control panel should allow updating the ToS and agreements easily.
📧 7. Onboarding Emails / Auto-Education
For developers:
After signup, send email: “How to craft winning proposals on Companeeds AI”
For companies:
After posting, send email: “How to choose the right developer for your project”
Include value-building educational material and links to support/FAQ.
🧭 8. Developer Filter + Search (UX Upgrade)
On the “Browse Developers” page:
Filters: Tech Stack (multi-select), Location, Experience Level, Rating
On the “Browse Projects” page:
Filters: Tech Stack Required, Budget Range, Posted Date, Urgency
📱 9. Mobile Optimization
Ensure all dashboards, forms, and modals are fully mobile-responsive.
Especially test:
Project posting flow
Proposal submission
Messaging/chat
🛠️ 10. Admin Dashboard
Add admin control panel with:
View/manage all dev and company applications
Approve/reject developers
See flagged reviews or messages
Track average project budgets and bids
View platform analytics (e.g., # projects posted this week)
🎖️ BONUS FEATURE: Companeeds PRO Badges
Add a “Verified Elite Developer” badge for top devs (admin-assigned)
Criteria could be: 5+ successful projects, 4.5+ average rating, or passing a tech screening
Show badge on their profile and proposals
🔁 Additional Notes:
Store all new fields in the backend DB.
Maintain existing project submission and proposal functionality.
Make sure all new forms and filters are integrated into the frontend UI cleanly.
Prioritize security and clean user experience.
