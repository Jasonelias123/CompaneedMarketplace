// REPLIT AI PROMPT — DO NOT DELETE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY

// PURPOSE: Transform UI and messaging to reflect "Companeeds = Toptal for AI" positioning, using layout like https://meet.beon.tech/talent-platform

// DO NOT REMOVE:
// - Firebase logic
// - Form submission functionality
// - Existing page routing
// - Developer browsing or pitch deck uploads

// MAKE THESE CHANGES:

// ✅ HOMEPAGE

// Replace the current hero section with a Beon.tech-style design (side-by-side layout, clean white background, large text, CTA button)

// - NEW HEADLINE: "Companeeds — AI talent for your company"
// - NEW SUBHEADLINE: "AI is reshaping every industry — fast. At Companeeds, we connect you with trusted AI experts so your business doesn't just keep up, it leads."
// - CTA BUTTON: "Get Matched Now" → links to /company-intake
// - Use modern typography (Poppins or Inter), clean grid/card layout, responsive design
// - Add fixed top navbar with: Logo + Links: "Companies", "AI Talent", "Login", and CTA button: "Get Matched"

// ✅ VALUE PROP — 3-STEP BLOCK

// Replace any existing 3-step "Post → Match → Result" flow with the following:

// 1️⃣ Tell Us About Your Business
// "We start by understanding what matters most to you — your industry, your challenges, and your biggest opportunities. Our team works closely with you to uncover where AI can create exponential efficiency, impact, and growth."

// 2️⃣ Get Matched with a Trusted AI Expert
// "In as little as 2 days, we connect you with a rigorously vetted expert who knows how to deliver results in your space. From expanding your sales pipeline, streamlining operations, automating workflows, or building a custom AI product — our experts help you unlock new levels of scale and growth fast."

// 3️⃣ See Measurable Results — or You Don’t Pay
// "We care about your results. If you’re not seeing real, meaningful outcomes — you don’t pay. Our model is built on trust, clarity, and delivering real value from day one."

// Display these 3 blocks horizontally or vertically stacked with icons and animations (fadeIn or slideUp) similar to Beon.tech

// ✅ COMPANY INTAKE PAGE (/company-intake)

// - Keep Firebase form logic as-is
// - Restyle the form to match Beon’s clean, centered card design
// - Header: "Let Us Match You With an AI Expert"
// - Add question: "What result would you like to achieve with AI?" (textarea)
// - Change field: "Where would you like to implement AI?" → "Which areas of your business would benefit most from AI? (e.g., sales, ops, support)"
// - Add disclaimer: “During our Beta, matching is free. After launch, Companeeds will be $75/month.”

// ✅ AI TALENT INTAKE PAGE

// - Change all references from "Developer" to "AI Talent" or "AI Consultant"
// - Page title: "Join the Companeeds AI Network"
// - Intro paragraph: "Apply to be matched with companies seeking AI integrations, automations, and custom solutions."
// - Add fields if missing: Specializations, AI Tools You Use, Example Past Results
// - Maintain Firebase functionality

// ✅ THANK-YOU PAGE (/thank-you)

// - Clean redesign to match Beon.tech confirmation UI
// - Message: "Thanks for submitting! We're reviewing your request and will match you with 1–3 AI consultants within 48 hours."

// ✅ STYLING

// - Use white background, dark text, blue or violet accent, and Poppins or Inter font
// - Apply consistent padding, spacing, shadows, and rounded corners
// - Use subtle animations on scroll (fadeIn/slideUp)

// ✅ FINAL REMINDER

// DO NOT overwrite or delete any working code or features
// ONLY update styles, layout, copy, and flow per above
