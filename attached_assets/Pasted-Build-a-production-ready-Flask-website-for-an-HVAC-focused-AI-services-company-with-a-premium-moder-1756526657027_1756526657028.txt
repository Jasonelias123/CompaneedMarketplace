Build a production-ready Flask website for an HVAC-focused AI services company with a premium, modern aesthetic. Use Tailwind via CDN, Inter + Manrope Google Fonts, subtle Framer-motion–style microinteractions implemented in lightweight JS (no external libs), and dark mode via prefers-color-scheme plus a manual toggle. Keep it fast, accessible, and mobile-first.
Objectives
Laser-target HVAC owners/operators.
Hero that immediately communicates outcomes with an elevated, trustworthy look.
Visual system: soft gradients, glassmorphism cards, gradient borders, subtle blurs, tasteful shadows, rounded-2xl radii.
Microinteractions: hover-lift on cards, smooth anchor scrolling, reveal-on-scroll fade/slide.
Dark mode + manual toggle.
One-page scroll + stubs for other trades.
Form via Formspree placeholder (clearly marked TODO).
Tech & Files
Flask, Tailwind via CDN (no Node), Google Fonts.
