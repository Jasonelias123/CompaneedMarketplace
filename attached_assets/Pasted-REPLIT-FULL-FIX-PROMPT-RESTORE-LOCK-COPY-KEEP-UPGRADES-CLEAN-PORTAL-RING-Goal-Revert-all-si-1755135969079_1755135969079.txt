REPLIT FULL FIX PROMPT — RESTORE + LOCK COPY, KEEP UPGRADES, CLEAN PORTAL RING

Goal:

Revert all site text copy to the version it had immediately before the last AI changed it.

Lock that copy so no automated edits change it again.

Preserve all design/motion upgrades already added.

Replace the current messy portal ring with a clean, elegant, high-end halo.

Keep colors, animations, and styling consistent across the entire site.

1) Restore Original Copy

Use Replit History/Checkpoints (or git log) to locate the checkpoint immediately before the copy was changed.

In index.html (and any partials), replace only text content with the checkpoint version.

Hero headline, subheadline, CTA, and microcopy.

“Why Companeeds” section (card titles/descriptions).

“Trusted By” heading and fine print.

“The Process” step titles/descriptions.

Final CTA heading, button text, and microcopy.

Do not alter the current HTML structure, CSS classes, IDs, or animation hooks — only revert the text.

2) Lock Copy

Add data-lock-copy="true" to each text-bearing element that was restored.

In main.js, add a safeguard:

document.querySelectorAll('[data-lock-copy="true"]').forEach(el => {
  const originalText = el.innerText;
  const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
    if (el.innerText !== originalText) {
      el.innerText = originalText;
      console.warn(`Blocked copy change on locked element: ${el}`);
    }
  });
  observer.observe(el, { characterData: true, subtree: true, childList: true });
});


This prevents future automated changes to the text.

3) Replace Portal Ring

Remove the current messy portal ring implementation.

Replace with a premium halo effect:

Thin (1–2px) circular stroke in royal-purple gradient (#6C4CFF → #5B36FF).

Subtle outer glow via blur.

Faint inner radial gradient (5–8% opacity).

Smooth breathing animation: 0.5–1% scale change over 6–8s with ease-in-out.

No rotation, wobble, or jagged edges.

Perfectly centered around the hero headline + CTA; always fully visible on all screen sizes.

On mobile, scale proportionally but maintain spacing from text.

Performance-friendly (GPU-accelerated transform + minimal layers).

4) Keep All Visual & Motion Upgrades

Maintain:

Starfield background (3 depth layers, subtle drift, occasional constellation lines).

Navbar/logo behavior (sticky, transparent over hero, blurred purple background after scroll, white ↔ deep purple wordmark).

Rocket twinkle every ~10s.

GSAP section reveals, parallax, and smooth scroll.

Glassmorphism process cards with SVG icons (no emojis).

Final CTA identical in style to hero CTA.

5) Color Discipline

Only use royal-purple palette (#6C4CFF, #5B36FF, #3A1CCC) + space black (#0A0420).

Remove all off-brand hues.

Keep gradient + glow identical across hero and final CTA.

6) Accessibility & Performance

Keep all alt text, aria labels, and keyboard navigation.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable parallax/animations while keeping design intact.

Optimize canvas rendering for 60fps.

Execute now, and when done:

Provide a side-by-side screenshot of the restored copy and current visuals for final approval.

Confirm the halo effect is clean, centered, and minimal.

Verify that no copy changes are possible without removing data-lock-copy.
