REPLIT FIX PROMPT — KEEP ORIGINAL COPY, UPGRADE EVERYTHING ELSE

You are a world-class front-end lead. Do not change any copy — keep every headline, subheadline, button label, section text, and microcopy exactly as it was before the last AI changed it. Only upgrade design, motion, and polish.

1) Hero / Page 1

Replace messy thick circle with refined portal ring:

Thin (1–2px) glowing stroke in royal-purple gradient (#6C4CFF → #5B36FF).

Outer blur glow + subtle inner halo (radial gradient).

Smooth, slow pulse (0.6–1% scale change) using GSAP — no wobble.

Ensure perfectly centered and never cropped on any screen size.

Starfield: keep original white-dot background, reduce density by ~25%, slow drift for calmer look.

Maintain original hero copy exactly as written. Keep same CTA and subcopy.

Keep original reassurance/microcopy exactly as before.

Navbar + logo:

Logo/wordmark back in navbar (top-left), sticky.

Transparent over hero; after 120px scroll → blurred translucent background with slight darkening; wordmark shifts white ↔ deep purple depending on section tone.

Subtle idle float on logo + rocket twinkle every ~10s.

2) Color Discipline

Only use royal-purple gradient family (#6C4CFF / #5B36FF / #3A1CCC) with black-to-space backgrounds (#0A0420).

Remove all off-brand hues and color shifts.

Final CTA must exactly match hero CTA in color, glow, and hover animation.

3) Section Visuals (Copy Untouched)

Why Companeeds: Keep all original text. Replace any emojis with small inline SVG line-icons in purple gradient. Maintain original card order and wording.

Trusted By: Keep headline, fine print, and logos as before. Make logos grayscale with shimmer hover; maintain fine print placement.

Process: Keep original copy. Replace Apple emojis with matching SVG line-icons (mic, diagram, boost). Glassmorphism cards with hover lift and tiny sparkle effects. Add subtle scroll-activated comet progress line across steps.

Final CTA: Keep all text exactly as before. Make styling identical to hero CTA.

4) Motion & Performance

Use GSAP for: portal pulse, smooth section reveals, navbar transitions.

Canvas for starfield; occasional subtle constellation lines.

Smooth scroll between sections; fade-up + small translate reveal animations.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable parallax/pulse in reduced mode.

Target 60fps; optimize particle rendering.

5) Accessibility

Keep all current alt text, aria labels, and keyboard accessibility intact.

Voice Agent modal remains fully accessible, with focus trapping and ESC close.

DO NOT change:

Any section copy, headline, subheadline, CTA text, bullet points, or microcopy.

Section order or structure (just refine visuals).

Implement these upgrades now while preserving every word exactly as it currently exists.
